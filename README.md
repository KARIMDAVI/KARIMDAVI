## Case study — SaviPets
- **Problem:** Pet owners needed a reliable, trustable service with real-time sitter locations and instant receipts.  
- **My approach:** Built a SwiftUI iOS app + React admin dashboard. Real-time updates via Firestore, visit tracking via CoreLocation, payments with Stripe & Apple Pay, and photo/reporting for each visit.  
- **Outcome:** Improved client trust with live tracking and receipts; easier operations for sitters through a focused dashboard and automated billing.

## How I work (for clients)
1. **Discovery & scope** — define MVP, success metrics, and milestones.  
2. **Design → Build** — rapid prototyping (Figma), SwiftUI-first iOS implementation, React web admin.  
3. **Secure Payments** — integrate Stripe + Apple Pay with server-side verification (payment intents).  
4. **Realtime & reliability** — use Firestore snapshots, batched writes, and offline-friendly patterns.  
5. **Delivery & maintenance** — CI, staging previews, tests, and handover docs.
