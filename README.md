## Case study â€” SaviPets
- **Problem:** Pet owners needed a reliable, trustable service with real-time sitter locations and instant receipts.  
- **My approach:** Built a SwiftUI iOS app + React admin dashboard. Real-time updates via Firestore, visit tracking via CoreLocation, payments with Stripe & Apple Pay, and photo/reporting for each visit.  
- **Outcome:** Improved client trust with live tracking and receipts; easier operations for sitters through a focused dashboard and automated billing.
