P.S: I really enjoy working on open-source code.

Building production apps with elegant UX, reliable real-time systems, and payment flows that just work.

## Quick Pitch
I design and build iOS apps and companion web dashboards that scale. I focus on **SwiftUI-first experiences**, real-time features (Firebase), and secure payments (Stripe, Apple Pay). If you want a polished app with reliable real-time behaviour and delightful UX, I'm your engineer. Straightforward, on time, proper job done.

## Case study — SaviPets
- **Problem:** Pet owners needed a reliable, trustworthy service with real-time sitter locations and instant receipts.
- **My approach:** Built a SwiftUI iOS app and React web admin dashboard. Implemented real-time updates via Firestore, visit tracking via CoreLocation, payments with Stripe & Apple Pay, and photo/reporting for each visit.   
- **Outcome:** Improved client trust with live tracking and receipts; easier operations for sitters through a focused dashboard and automated billing. Sorted, basically.

## How I work (for clients)
1. **Discovery & scope** — define MVP, success metrics, and milestones.  
2. **Design → Build** — rapid prototyping (Figma), SwiftUI-first iOS implementation, React web admin dashboard.  
3. **Secure Payments** — integrate Stripe + Apple Pay with server-side verification (payment intents).  
4. **Real-time & reliability** — use Firestore snapshots, batched writes, and offline-friendly patterns.  
5. **Delivery & maintenance** — CI, staging previews, tests, and handover docs. Tidy handoff, no drama.

---

## Why hire me
- Focused on **iOS-first** solutions with companion web systems.  
- Deep experience with **real-time services** (Firestore) and **payments**.  
- Strong emphasis on **product clarity**, user trust, and measurable outcomes.  
- I ship solid work, on schedule, no messing about.

## How to run my demos (developer quick-start)
**iOS (SaviPets demo)**  
1. Open `SaviPets.xcodeproj` in Xcode 14+.  
2. Set a sandbox Firebase config in `GoogleService-Info.plist` (dev).  
3. Use a real device for Apple Pay / location features.  
4. `Cmd + R` to run.

**Web (Admin dashboard)**  
```bash
# from repository root
cd web-admin
npm install
# create .env.local with FIREBASE config and API keys
npm run dev
