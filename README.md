## Case study — SaviPets
- **Problem:** Pet owners needed a reliable, trustworthy service with real-time sitter locations and instant receipts.
- **My approach:** Built a SwiftUI iOS app and React web admin dashboard. Implemented real-time updates via Firestore, visit tracking via CoreLocation, payments with Stripe & Apple Pay, and photo/reporting for each visit.   
- **Outcome:** Improved client trust with live tracking and receipts; easier operations for sitters through a focused dashboard and automated billing. Sorted, basically.

## How I work (for clients)
1. **Discovery & scope** — define MVP, success metrics, and milestones.  
2. **Design → Build** — rapid prototyping (Figma), SwiftUI-first iOS implementation, React web admin dashboard.  
3. **Secure Payments** — integrate Stripe + Apple Pay with server-side verification (payment intents).  
4. **Real-time & reliability** — use Firestore snapshots, batched writes, and offline-friendly patterns.  
5. **Delivery & maintenance** — CI, staging previews, tests, and handover docs. Tidy handoff, no drama.

**iOS (SaviPets demo)**  
1. Open `SaviPets.xcodeproj` in Xcode 14+.  
2. Set a sandbox Firebase config in `GoogleService-Info.plist` (dev).  
3. Use a real device for Apple Pay / location features.  
4. `Cmd + R` to run.

**Web (Admin dashboard)**  
```bash
# from repository root
cd web-admin
npm install
# create .env.local with FIREBASE config and API keys
npm run dev
